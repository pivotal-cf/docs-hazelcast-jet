This topic describes how developers use Hazelcast Jet for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

After your PCF operator installs the Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF tile, it automatically registers itself to the Marketplace.

Follow these steps to create an instance of the Hazelcast Jet service based on an available plan and bind it to your app.
The plans available to you are determined by your PCF operator. 
For more information about configuring plans, see [Installing and Configuring Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF](installing.html).

## <a id="marketplace"></a> Checking Availability

1. To check availability of Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF, enter the following command:

    ```
    $ cf marketplace
    ```
    For example, 

    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace 
Getting services from marketplace in org system / space system as admin... 
OK<br>
service         plans                            description 
app-autoscaler 	bronze, gold                     Scales bound applications in response to load (beta) 
hazelcast-jet   t2.micro, t2.small, m3.medium    Hazelcast Jet Service
    </pre>

## <a id="create-service"></a> Create and Bind a Service to Your App

1. Create a file named `hazelcast-jet.json` using this [sample Hazelcast Jet JSON file](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-code-samples/blob/master/integration/pcf/hazelcast-jet.json) as a template.

1. Replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with your active Hazelcast Enterprise License or a trial license. For more information, see [License](index.html#license). 

1. To create a cluster, enter the following command:
  
    ```
    $ cf create-service hazelcast-jet PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME -c hazelcast-jet.json
    ```
    For example, 
    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service hazelcast-jet t2.micro micro-cluster -c hazelcast-jet.json
Creating service instance micro-cluster in org system / space system as admin...
OK<br> 
Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service micro-cluster' to check operation status. 
    </pre>

3. To bind the service to your app, enter the following commands:

    ```
    $ cf bind-service MY-APPLICATION SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME
    $ cf restage MY-APPLICATION
    ```
    For example,
    <pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service myapp micro-cluster
$ cf restage myapp
    </pre>

4. Start using the Hazelcast Jet. Necessary parameters are passed to your application in
 `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables.
