1. Click **First On-demand plan**. In the **Hazelcast on-demand plan** pane, do the following:
    1. Enter a **Plan name**.
    1. Enter a **Plan description**.

        For an example of how the plan name and description appear on the command line, see [Step&nbsp;1](using.html#marketplace) in the _Using Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF_ topic.

    1. Specify the number of **Hazelcast Jet instances** for this plan. This property defines the number of Hazelcast Jet instances to be created.
     It can be overridden for each service instance when creating a service instance by using the `instanceCount` parameter. For more information, see [Step&nbsp;2](using.html#create-service) in the _Using Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF_ topic.
    1. Select a **Hazelcast Jet VM type**. Choose a suitable VM type according to your data needs and processing power requirements.
    1.  If you are planning on using features like [Hot Restart](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.7/manual/html-single/index.html#hot-restart-persistence) that require a persistent disk, select a **Hazelcast Jet Disk type**. Otherwise, you can leave this option empty because Hazelcast Jet, by default, does not require a persistent disk.
    1. Select the **Hazelcast Jet availability zone(s)** where you want to create VMs for this plan.
    1. Click **Save**.

1. If you want to modify the additional Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF plans, repeat the step above to configure the second and third on-demand plans.

1. Click **Errands** and ensure that both **Register on-demand broker** and **Deregister on-demand broker** are selected. 

    These are necessary to create and destroy Hazelcast Jet service instances.
