This documentation describes how to install, configure, and use Hazelcast Jet for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.
Developers can provision Hazelcast Jet clusters by creating instances of the service plans using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF uses an on-demand services SDK, which is a part of [Pivotal Cloud Services SDK](https://network.pivotal.io/products/on-demand-services-sdk),
to fully utilize BOSH-2.0 features and let you provision instances more flexibly.

Features of Hazelcast Jet Enterprise for PCF include the following:

* Based on [Hazelcast Jet Enterprise](https://hazelcast.com/jet), Ultra-Fast Stream Processing Framework
* The ability to dynamically pass your Hazelcast Jet configuration in JSON format when creating services
* An on-demand service broker that dynamically creates and scales Hazelcast Jet clusters without pre-provisioning blocks of VMs

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

If you change `managementCenterConfig` in your JSON configuration file, all VMs shut down at the same time.
This means that you lose all cluster data unless you are persisting that data elsewhere.
